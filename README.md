jitsi-meet
=========

Installs and configures the [Jitsi Meet] videoconferencing software.


Requirements
------------

You should have DNS pointed at the server already, and SSL keys. If you don't have SSL
keys for the domain yet, consider using the excellent [thefinn93.letsencrypt] Ansible role
to obtain (free!) SSL certs from [LetsEncrypt].

You will also need to expose ports 443 TCP and 10000 UDP for the Jitsi Meet
components to work. By default the role will use `ufw` to allow these ports. If you
use another host-based firewall solution such as iptables, set
`jitsi_meet_configure_firewall: false`. If you use AWS or similar, you'll need to
expose those ports in the associated Security Group.

Role Variables
--------------

```yaml
# The default cert files are /var/lib/prosody/localhost.{crt,key}
# NOT setting them here, because empty strings for custom certs will
# cause the custom Nginx config tasks to be skipped.
jitsi_meet_ssl_cert_path: ''
jitsi_meet_ssl_key_path: ''

# Without SSL, "localhost" is the correct default. If SSL info is provided,
# then we'll need a real domain name. Using Ansible's inferred FQDN, but you
# can set the variable value explicitly if you use a shorter hostname
jitsi_meet_server_name: "{{ ansible_fqdn if jitsi_meet_ssl_cert_path else 'localhost' }}"

# Only "anonymous" auth is supported, which lets anyone use the videoconference server.
jitsi_meet_authentication: anonymous

# The Debian package installation of jitsi-meet will generate secrets for the components.
# The role will read the config file and preserve the secrets even while templating.
# If you wish to generate your own secrets and use those, override these vars, but make
# sure to store the secrets securely, e.g. with ansible-vault or credstash.
jitsi_meet_videobridge_secret: ''
jitsi_meet_jicofo_secret: ''
jitsi_meet_jicofo_password: ''

# Default auth information, used in multiple service templates.
jitsi_meet_jicofo_user: focus
jitsi_meet_jicofo_port: 5347

# The default config file at /etc/jitsi/videobridge/config claims the default port
# for JVB is "5275", but the manual install guide references "5347".
# https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/manual-install.md
jitsi_meet_videobridge_port: 5347

# A recent privacy-friendly addition, see here for details:
# https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/422
# https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/427
jitsi_meet_disable_third_party_requests: true

# Screensharing config for Chrome. You'll need to build and package a browser
# extension specifically for your domain; see https://github.com/jitsi/jidesha
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_chrome_method: 'ext'
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_chrome_ext_id: 'diibjkoicjeejcmhdnailmkgecihlobk'

# Path to local extension on disk, for copying to target host. The remote filename
# will be the basename of the path provided here.
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_chrome_extension_filename: ''

# Screensharing config for Firefox. Set max_version to '42' and disabled to 'false'
# if you want to use screensharing under Firefox.
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_firefox_ext_id: 'null'
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_firefox_disabled: true
jitsi_meet_desktop_sharing_firefox_max_version_ext_required: '-1'

# These debconf settings represent answers to interactive prompts during installation
# of the jitsi-meet deb package. If you use custom SSL certs, you may have to set more options.
jitsi_meet_debconf_settings:
  - name: jitsi-meet
    question: jitsi-meet/jvb-hostname
    value: "{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}"
    vtype: string
  - name: jitsi-meet
    question: jitsi-meet/jvb-serve
    value: "false"
    vtype: boolean
  - name: jitsi-meet-prosody
    question: jitsi-meet-prosody/jvb-hostname
    value: "{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}"
    vtype: string

# Role will automatically install configure ufw with jitsi-meet port holes.
# If you're managing a firewall elsewise, set this to false, and ufw will be skipped.
jitsi_meet_configure_firewall: true
```

Screen sharing
--------------
Jitsi Meet supports screen sharing functionality via browser extensions.
Only the party sharing the screen needs the extension installedâ€”other participants
in the meeting will be able to view the shared screen without installing anything.
You'll need to build your own browser extension for Chrome and/or Firefox.
See the [Jidesha] documentation for detailed build instructions. This role
has only been tested with custom Chrome extensions.

Chrome forbids installation of extensions from unapproved websites, so you must
download the `.crx` file directly, then navigate to `chrome://extensions` and
drag-and-drop the extension to install it. If you want to grant another
participant screen-sharing support, share the URL for the extension with them
via the Jitsi Meet text chat pane.

Dependencies
------------

It's technically not a dependency, but you should check out [thefinn93.letsencrypt]
for astoundingly easy SSL certs.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- name: Configure jitsi-meet server.
  hosts: jitsi
  vars:
    # Change this to match the DNS entry for your host IP.
    jitsi_meet_server_name: meet.example.com
  roles:
    - role: thefinn93.letsencrypt
      become: yes
      letsencrypt_email: "webmaster@{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}"
      letsencrypt_cert_domains:
        - "{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}"
      tags: letsencrypt

    - role: ansible-role-jitsi-meet
      jitsi_meet_ssl_cert_path: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}/fullchain.pem"
      jitsi_meet_ssl_key_path: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ jitsi_meet_server_name }}/privkey.pem"
      become: yes
      tags: jitsi

## Alternative
- name: Configure jitsi-meet server (2).
  hosts: jitsi
  vars:
    - jitsi_meet_ssl_generate: 'letsencrypt'
    - jitsi_meet_server_name: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.xip.io"
  roles:
    - ansible-role-jitsi-meet
      become: yes

```

Running the tests
-----------------

This role uses [Molecule] and [ServerSpec] for testing. To use it:

```
pip install molecule
gem install serverspec
molecule test
```

You can also run selective commands:

```
molecule idempotence
molecule verify
```

See the [Molecule] docs for more info.
